## About me

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of York, studying within the [Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence CDT](http://iggi.org.uk/). I previously completed a Master's degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at York, have worked at BAE Systems as a research associate, and have completed a placement doing research in York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis.

## Research

As part of my PhD with IGGI I am looking into methods of generating and using abstractions to guide searching using [Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://www.mcts.ai/). My primary supervisor is [Daniel Kudenko](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~kudenko/) at the University of York, and [Simon M. Lucas](http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/lucas/) at the University of Essex is my co-supervisor.

Apart from MCTS, I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, bio-inspired computing, and arguing about programming languages.

## Personal

In my spare time I enjoy playing videogames, watching films, and hiking. When I have the time I might work on a couple of side projects, usually documented on my personal website [`www.bedder.co.uk`](http://bedder.co.uk).
